      <p>So I stepped up as a gameplay developer and guided the founders more and more into their project management decisions while programming for the game projects they had in mind.</p>\
      <p>Our first projects were only mobile casual games but we went more and more into serious projects across the years. We started with a first game using OpenGL ES on Android, using Java and our own \"coder art\" assets. Then we translated our small engine into C++ so we could use it as a layer on top of OpenGL for iOS. Interfacing the Android Java ecosystem with our engine in C++ would be then possible using JNI. We had our own small multiplatform game engine that we used for two other games.</p>\
      <p>On our last mobile game, I took more initiative on the game producing and game design side, as our games were frankly not that good as they could be and were commercial failures. This meant for instance organizing focus test sessions with \"normal\" people I recruited from classifieds, managing external freelancers for art & music, participating in the recruitment process in order to grow the studio.</p>",

      content: "<p>After our experience in mobile games, my bosses realised that the mobile market was too crowded to be successful in it the easy way and we needed to go full in in order to expect success. They started a new project which would be the first PC oriented AAA video game of the studio.</p>\
      <p>The game concept was quite novative back then. With the MOBA genre being slowly the most played in all of the multiplayer genres, we had this idea of mixing MOBA mechanics with a third person shooter. Some sort of mix between League of Legends and Gears of War. Such a project being highly ambitious for our team, I saw the risk of this project to be the last one of this studio and decided to take even more initiative regarding the game producing process. This made me the project manager of the studio, aka game producer.</p>\
      <p>In short, I managed a small team of game creators. I managed the schedule of production and I was head of game design. Lots of paperwork, even more programming work. This was my first experience managing a team in such a specific field of software development and, hell, did I do a lot of mistakes. Excellent soft skills are needed in team management, which I lacked as a 25 years old suddenly having to manage people for the first time. At the height of the project, we had 15 people working on it and we even started a PR round by taking part in interviews for indie gaming websites, talking about the project on a local radio, and so on.</p>\
      <p>But all the effort was not put to good use. It took months to program simple game mechanics with our programming team wanting to replace our game designers, our art team was losing time mixing up game assets creation process, website creation & game trailers edition, game mechanics were added to our game documents by our bosses without any consultation, the server infrastructure was heavily underestimated... and so on, and so on. A lot of mistakes were made, from me included, and we were simply not effective.</p>\
      <p>The video game was still not properly playable after more than two years of development. The search began for the culprits and heads started to roll, the most experienced of my colleagues first and the loudest last. Me getting fired somewhere in between. This did not prevent the game to be never fully released, the people the friendliest to management from getting fired and the studio to close six months after my firing.</p>\
      <p>An absolutely exhausting but rich experience.</p>",

      <p>Our team is in charge of the communication to the different supply-side platforms that are involved in our business models (Xandr, Google, Facebook...) to create and synchronize such deals but also gather the data (number of display, clicks, formats used, etc.) from those SSPs and prepare it to be used in our apps for the online marketing branch.</p>\

      <p>One of the other key to the good functioning of our team is the overall goal for code quality, security and our pull requests process.

We are a team within a very international company, which itself is part of a formerly very german firm.
