      <p>So I stepped up as a gameplay developer and guided the founders more and more into their project management decisions while programming for the game projects they had in mind.</p>\
      <p>Our first projects were only mobile casual games but we went more and more into serious projects across the years. We started with a first game using OpenGL ES on Android, using Java and our own \"coder art\" assets. Then we translated our small engine into C++ so we could use it as a layer on top of OpenGL for iOS. Interfacing the Android Java ecosystem with our engine in C++ would be then possible using JNI. We had our own small multiplatform game engine that we used for two other games.</p>\
      <p>On our last mobile game, I took more initiative on the game producing and game design side, as our games were frankly not that good as they could be and were commercial failures. This meant for instance organizing focus test sessions with \"normal\" people I recruited from classifieds, managing external freelancers for art & music, participating in the recruitment process in order to grow the studio.</p>",

      content: "<p>After our experience in mobile games, my bosses realised that the mobile market was too crowded to be successful in it the easy way and we needed to go full in in order to expect success. They started a new project which would be the first PC oriented AAA video game of the studio.</p>\
      <p>The game concept was quite novative back then. With the MOBA genre being slowly the most played in all of the multiplayer genres, we had this idea of mixing MOBA mechanics with a third person shooter. Some sort of mix between League of Legends and Gears of War. Such a project being highly ambitious for our team, I saw the risk of this project to be the last one of this studio and decided to take even more initiative regarding the game producing process. This made me the project manager of the studio, aka game producer.</p>\
      <p>In short, I managed a small team of game creators. I managed the schedule of production and I was head of game design. Lots of paperwork, even more programming work. This was my first experience managing a team in such a specific field of software development and, hell, did I do a lot of mistakes. Excellent soft skills are needed in team management, which I lacked as a 25 years old suddenly having to manage people for the first time. At the height of the project, we had 15 people working on it and we even started a PR round by taking part in interviews for indie gaming websites, talking about the project on a local radio, and so on.</p>\
      <p>But all the effort was not put to good use. It took months to program simple game mechanics with our programming team wanting to replace our game designers, our art team was losing time mixing up game assets creation process, website creation & game trailers edition, game mechanics were added to our game documents by our bosses without any consultation, the server infrastructure was heavily underestimated... and so on, and so on. A lot of mistakes were made, from me included, and we were simply not effective.</p>\
      <p>The video game was still not properly playable after more than two years of development. The search began for the culprits and heads started to roll, the most experienced of my colleagues first and the loudest last. Me getting fired somewhere in between. This did not prevent the game to be never fully released, the people the friendliest to management from getting fired and the studio to close six months after my firing.</p>\
      <p>An absolutely exhausting but rich experience.</p>",

        date: "11.04.2025",
        content: `<p>Almost five years ago, I got hired on a big company dedicated to journalism, called Axel Springer. The name comes from its founder, a german tycoon who became rich and successful by founding Germany's first tabloid: Bild.</p>
        <p>Everybody knows Bild in Germany. Everybody also knows its reputation and the reputation of its founder: focusing on sensationalism, big attractive and absolutely partial titles and, even sometimes, sharing not-so-fact-checked articles, aka nowadays "fake news". I still have this edition in mind in which on one page, there was an article complaining about immigrants committing more crime than "normal" Germans, and on the opposite page, an article about a racism scandal in Germany's biggest extreme-right party. I am pretty sure putting these two pages in front of each other, which would attract two types of people situated in both extreme opposite sides of the political spectrum, was absolutely on purpose. People pissed by an article would probably come back to buy the newspaper again.<br/>
        Anyway, the point is: everybody in Germany knows Bild. Because everybody complains about it... but, most important, everybody reads it. Literally millions of daily readers enjoying the cheeky attitude of the newspaper, summed up by this internal slogan that still resonates in me: "Aber du liest es doch!", translating into something like "but, still, you're reading it!".</p>
        <p>So, yeah, I worked for this group. But Springer does not come down to only Bild. There are big subsidiaries, in the classifieds business for instance, but also other newspapers that made me actually proud to work for. In the portfolio of the group, I could work for Welt and Politico. Welt had to be the most famous serious german newspaper where I am from, often quoted when something was happening in Germany. And Politico, well, we are talking about the go-to newspaper for diplomats and public servants in Washington. What made me also proud, was the work culture there. When I started at the tech branch of Axel Springer, there was this refreshing wind of freedom, work/life balance and free-thinking. The company was literally searching for engineers and product designers with a level of expertise only coming from unsual careers and unsual lifepaths. My own case. This was for me, the "Auslander", an incredible chance to integrate into the german society and get to work with amazingly talented people.</p>
        
        <p>But this month I left the company for another job. I won't even comment on managers promising me a promotion I definitely deserved but in the end refusing it because of "cost cuts". It turns out, the budget is definitely there and I just wanted in the end a title to show off on LinkedIn that after years of efforts, yeah, my career still slowly goes forward. Well, these are the usual shenanigans of the corporate world, right?</p>
        <p>I won't even comment on the shady financial buy-out to get the principal investor out of the way and "go back to a family business". Dramatic shift in the philosophy of the company. A sudden return to the roots. I also won't comment further on the tech bro who got appointed as new CTO, "who studied computer science" and yet improbable decisions after another did everything to push the excellent talents who were keeping the ship afloat out of the door. I am not even including myself in these people. I have the tendency to always consider myself average, I left after lots of big names were already gone and, still, I could find a new job which offers twice a better environement.</p>
        <p>The reason I left was the arrival of AI within the company and seeing managers one after another catching the virus.</p>
        <p>Watch out! Before you tell yourself that this is yet another rant from an engineer trying to gatekeep his trade, which is now doable by any peasant with a computer: I use AI every single day. ChatGPT, Claude, Codex and its set of skills, RooCode, Copilot and Ollama with a set of open models. I even built a RAG tool which translates Figma designs into pull requests on GitHub (which I am, by the way, currently rebuilding from scratch, <a href="http://framecommit.app">check it out</a>). I *am* an AI user.</p>
        <p>I have never been that efficient in my work. My mind tends easily to lose itself into details. "Why the hell is this method not working?" And I would spent ten times more time than necessary trying to achieve something, being called once a "submarine coder", starting a task, losing myself deep into it and coming back at the surface when the whole mission is done to a 100%. Now I don't do that anymore. I can deliver. No more algorithm that everybody knows but that I try to reinvent. I just get something that somewhat works, then understand its big picture and, finally, I can make my own jam, often better but with something that already works for the people waiting for me. This fits the way my mind works really good.</p>
        


        <p>To quote the CTO: "Jeder kann jetzt coden" ("Anybody can code now"). Proud to have "coded" a bot managing his schedule using OpenClaw. The same week, our security team was sending an email, company-wide, forbidding its use internally to avoid leaked secrets, security flaws introduction and explosion of costs. The peasants with computer were feeling like gods. Finally they will be able to get rid of these engineering divas who kept asking for indecent salaries while not be able to push a one word Jira ticket to "done" in five minutes. Now AI does it!</p>
        <p>What these people couldn't understand: the peasants were us all this time long. Yes, *anybody* can code and it has always been like that. I made a career out of it while having in math the worst grades of my promotion and a questionable sense of logic. What made the difference was the will to learn. The will to understand what is happening in the machine. Owning your technical solution, owning your code. And writing your code was always the easiest step in this. But reading code and understanding what it does, especially if the code is from someone more skilled or your own self from six months before. The only difference AI made: it *can* make these processes faster.</p>
        <p>I remember that one of my manager was until a few months ago sheltered from this virus. Then he got it from another manager showing him how to use Claude. He went apeshit crazy on a sunday evening when he was finding out that using words, he could get a webpage with javascript. He was proud telling us he spent his whole night working on it.</p>
        <p>Then he told us, without any hesitation and realising the implication of such a sentence, that he stopped at 1AM because his app was not working anymore and he had no idea about what the code was missing. He was telling us "no idea why it was not working, but the gap to make it work can't be that small".</p>
        <p>Mate, this very gap is what we call "software engineering".</p>`

        content: `<h3>How AI makes software engineering easier and faster</h3>
        <ul>
<li>Big picture questions like "how should I structure my app with features A, B and C, using the framework XYZ?", something that search engines and Stack Overflow were not offering</li>
<li>Typical noobie questions for a framework or technology that you never used, like: "how do you intercept a response in Angular and modify its content?", "how does trilinear filtering work in a graphic engine?"</li>
<li>Specific technical questions on a niche feature, if you explain the context through and through, describe the structure of your app or infrastructure (or better: have a nice subscription to Claude which gives you a >50k code lines context) which will give better odds for the result of the algorithm. Example: "in the controller XYZController, when I use the createSomeEntity endpoint, I am not getting the field XYZ of said entity although it is marked as serializable and should be included in the response JSON. What am I missing?"</li>
<li>Creating simple CRUD apps from scratch, without any legacy codebase: "Give me a backend app using NestJS with a simple user, product & order management system, with register, login, order a product & lost password functionalities."</li>
</ul>
<h3>How AI does *not* make software engineering easier and faster</h3>
<ul>
<li>Having team leads and product managers create an app themselves without reading or understanding a single line of the generated code and then giving it to developers saying: "See? I already did your job. What's wrong with you guys? Are you getting paid spending your time on Youtube?"</li>
<li>Having CCQ specialists merging Pull Requests without any testing, breaking production, because AI told them to change a single line inside a pom.xml or a package.json and "it's just a microscopic change".</li>
<li>Pushing veteran software engineers out of the door, those who spent 15 to 20 years in your company learning your own business logic and building the existing code base to automatize said business processes, all because "the code they produced is bad: 'the AI' cannot understand it".</li>
<li>Thinking that word-suggestion algorithms (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor... well, the whole new "AI" wave) offer deterministic solutions instead of answers whose probability of functioning depends on the amount of training data on the problem in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these examples are direct testimonies from my SE friends or me, by the way.</p>`

        originalLink: "https://www.facebook.com/516573607/posts/pfbid02dCUt8G64cpo1QWWz2zi5ioe4K3RBdDs2jtyD2kmnDic9HuaJnixBXxSz79tAydEpl/",
        content: `<p>Petite anecdote polonaise vu que je n'ai plus trop de raisons de me retenir et vu le climat politique ambiant en Europe.</p>
<p>Séjour à Poznan pour que la petite profite à nouveau de l’aquapark, comme promis il y a bien longtemps. On se retrouve à chercher un parking pour visiter le centre ville et, passant une barrière grande ouverte qui mène vers un parc de stationnement privé, je vais à la caisse pour savoir quand et comment on doit payer, histoire d'éviter le piège à touristes.</p>
<p>Je me retrouve à cette caisse face à un croisement de Pierre Bellemare et Shrek qui aurait trop loupé ses séances d'UV, joliment couperosé depuis probablement ses seize ans et pour qui visiblement une encyclopédie révèle plus du calage de meuble que de la source objective d'informations.</p>
<p>Faisant fi de mes préjugés d'occidental arrogant, je m'approche du monsieur et, après l'avoir salué sommairement dans la langue de Marie Skłodowska, je lui demande, ne pouvant m'exprimer suffisamment correctement dans son langage, s'il parle anglais. Ou bien allemand. Ou bien français.</p>
<p>À chaque question, il rit. Mais quelle idée de ma part de demander à un professionnel faisant face quotidiennement à des tombereaux de touristes de s'exprimer sommairement parmi un panel de langues qui permettent de couvrir environ les deux tiers de la population d’Europe ? Qu'à cela ne tienne, la transaction s'effectue via Google translate et je passe la rigolade assumée de ce monsieur.</p>
<p>Mais vint le soir et le moment pour moi de payer. Visiblement la soirée était bien entamée vu les vapeurs éthyliques émanant de la cahute et l'élocution de mon hôte devenue légèrement hasardeuse. Avec lui, un ami est venu regarder sur le lieu de travail un match de football, qui passe sur une télé derrière eux.</p>
<p>PSG joue contre l'Inter. Je n'aime pas le foot et encore moins le PSG. Mais bref, je suis là pour payer ma place et si possible sans trop parler vu les différences de langage et le manque criant d’atomes crochus entre nous. Je le salue à nouveau et lui tend mon billet. Le coquin apostrophe son collègue : " Lui, il ne comprend pas.”</p>
<p>Mais, cher être difforme, ta langue, je ne la parle pas encore bien, ce n'est pas que je ne la comprends pas.</p>
<p>Il continue en polonais : “C'est parce qu'il parle africain.”</p>
<p>Je regarde la télé et  je revois le PSG avec son équipe parisienne typiquement bigarrée. Mon accent français m’a auparavant trahi. Alors que son collègue s’exclaffe de rire, je comprends enfin le racisme incroyable de la blague, que j’ai déjà entendu plusieurs fois de la part de Polonais du cru. À chaque fois mon hilarité était modeste et l’inculture agricole que j’observais en face me laissait perplexe.</p>
<p>Le lendemain, je me levai avec une information dont en vérité j’en ai absolument rien à foutre : Paris a gagné 5 - 0 en finale. Pas un petit 2 - 1 mais bel et bien une distribution de fessées. Je compris enfin l’ire de ce monsieur et son trait resplendissant de la veille. Lorsque nous sommes allés nous garer dans le même parking ce jour là, je me suis précipité vers la cahute pour entonner un chant que jamais je n’aurais imaginé vouloir chanter : “Pariiis eeest magiiique !!”</p>
<p>Mais le bougre n'était pas là en ce beau matin ! Probablement trop occupé à digérer les tomes de philosophie liquide qu’il avait parcouru toute la soirée avec son ami. Ma déception n’était toutefois qu’infime. Je commençai à assumer pleinement cette arrogance occidentale.</p>
<p>Car très vite le souvenir de l’insulte de la veille me rappela que pendant que ce triste personnage brûlait certainement dans sa poêle à charbon ses emballages plastiques Tatra pour se chauffer l’hiver, des noirs, NOS noirs, faisaient la queue pour venir vivre chez nous, gagner leur vie dans NOTRE pays et pour être ou devenir des Français.</p>
<p>Pour être des gens qui disent bonjour en rentrant dans une maison, qui bouffent trop, trop souvent et trop longtemps, qui baisent sans vouloir faire trop d’enfants, qui demandent comment ça va même si uniquement ce protocole les forcent à sortir de leur mauvaise humeur, qui gueulent pour oui ou pour un non, qui mangent leur baguette pas trop cuite, PAS brûlée et qui, car trop gentils et polis, se font aussi bouffer par les véritables païens de ce monde qui brûlent des voitures à la moindre opportunité ou voient encore le mariage non comme une aventure à deux mais comme une simple transaction financière.</p>
<p>Des gens trop gentils face à ce genre d’énergumènes au degré de civilisation en dessous de l’acceptable, peu importe leur bord ou le dieu qu’il vénère… mais le paradoxe réside dans le fait que la civilisation et la civilité consiste justement à accepter et faire preuve de compassion face à ce genre d’énergumènes. Lourd fardeau, lourde croix à porter dirais-je même.</p>
<p>Mais c'est ça, la culture française, celle qui attire des gens de par le globe et les poussent à inscrire leurs gosses immigrés de deuxième ou troisième génération au club de foot de banlieue parisienne. Et la banlieue influence Paris. Et Paris influence LE MONDE.</p>
<p>Et ça, ça rend fier, bordel à cul de putain de nom de dieu de merde.</p>`

        content: `<p>Hallo an alle!</p>
<p>Ihr wisst vielleicht, dass ich vor langer Zeit ein kleines, kostenloses Webspiel im Rahmen der Wahlen in meinem Heimatland entwickelt hatte. Ziel des Spiels war, als ein Politiker alles zu sagen, was man sagen muss, um sich bei möglichst vielen Menschen beliebt zu machen.</p>
<p>Ich lebe seit acht Jahren in Deutschland, habe aber noch nicht die deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft. Von daher habe ich leider nicht die Möglichkeit, bei den nächsten Wahlen nächste Woche meine Stimme abzugeben.</p>
<p>Meine Botschaft für diese Wahlen wäre: geht wählen!</p>
<p>Aber meine zweite Botschaft wäre auch: wählt richtig! Hört nicht auf die Marktschreier, die auf den aktuellen Ereignissen reiten, um von sich reden zu machen, **unabhängig von ihrer politischen Orientierung**.</p>
<p>Im Zuge der Wahlen in Deutschland wollte ich diese Botschaft hinter diesem Spiel zurückgeben und habe das Spiel auf Deutsch übersetzt. Probiert es aus und teilt euren positiven Meinungsrekord!</p>

        content: `<p>I just finished a new version of the game!</p>
<p>It is still a private project and only people in my social circle will be testing this version. I hope the next iteration will bring some sort of public version.&nbsp;Please do not forget that this project is built on my free time. Most of my commits on the code are between 9pm and 2am, nothing else. The rest of the day, I have a real job and I sometimes have to sleep! Well, I actually would <strong>love</strong> to sleep but I also have a charming&nbsp;toddler which requires some sort of maintenance, like playing&nbsp;with her and telling her she is my favourite human being in the world. It can be&nbsp;tough sometimes, right?</p>
<p>Here is the changelog for this version:
</p>
<ul><li>The third type of the basic units is implemented: the game has now artillery.</li><li>Soldiers can now sometimes be stunned and will crawl for a while when there is an explosion close to them</li><li>Squad deployment is only possible in the controlled zone in front of the frontline, like intended as a base game mechanics of my game concept. I also added a visual feedback on the map&nbsp;showing that.</li><li>UI improvement: there is now a "progress bar", which represents which part of the frontline is advancing or falling. There is also a&nbsp;fast travel when you click on it.</li><li>UI improvements: the squad badges on the field and in the bottom menu have now more information about the squad. I also included&nbsp;tooltips when you hover these badges.</li><li>I did a big round of game variables balancing (mostly weapon accuracy and speed).</li><li>A start&nbsp;menu has been added.</li><li>Enhanced sound effects, switching to external sound effects instead of the game engine's default sound filters.</li><li>I fixed a nasty bug preventing a unit to retreat in order with we give this order.</li></ul>
<p>My goal for the next version will be to have the game playable by strangers,&nbsp;probably as in the form of&nbsp;a closed beta. But I first have some important game mechanics in mind, like ammo consuption, resupply and the possiblity to deploy ammo cache/storage.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>`
